Adaptive design is the practice of designing layouts that adapt to specific
breakpoints and devices.

To implement adaptive layouts effectively:

- First, consider the device's window class width to determine layout changes, then adjust for height.
- Android leverages responsive design concepts, similar to web development, employing flexible grids and images to create layouts that respond effectively to their context.

For design guidelines about adapting layouts to expanded screen sizes, read the
[Support different screen sizes](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/adaptive/support-different-display-sizes) developers guide in Compose and the M3
[Applying Layout](https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/applying-layout/expanded) page. You can also check out the Android
[large screen canonical](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/large-screen-canonical-layouts) gallery for inspiration and implementation of
large screen layouts.

## Think adaptive

Adaptive should be be the default when designing your app. The Android mobile
market is constantly evolving, so you can't only think of mobile as handset
phones. Instead it should include everything from handset phones, foldables,
tablets, and everything in between.

While certain features and use cases may not make sense on every screen size or
form factor.
Adaptive design allows your users more freedom regarding ergonomics,
usability, and app quality.

## Methods and quality

You can start by designing key screens (communicate the essential concepts or
your app) with class sizes as breakpoints to act as guidelines for the rest of
your app. These hero experiences can highlight differentiated adaptive and form
factor qualities. Or design content to be responsive at a foundational level by
notating how content should be constrained, expand, or reflow.

### Do

Set a max width on content and components to prevent stretching full width.

### Don't

Allow content to stretch full width.

### Do

Think in terms of containment or panes.

<br />

Use intrinsic and visual containers to group elements together. Panes can move
in, hide, expand, be constrained, or pop up. Thinking with panes makes designing
across all mobile devices easier.

Allow elements to shift and rearrange by focusing on how elements adapt to the
grid. Consider vertical change for elements and combine with constraints and
presentation changes.

A high quality app should meet the differentiated tier in [core app](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/core-app-quality) and
[large screen quality](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screen-app-quality) guidelines.
