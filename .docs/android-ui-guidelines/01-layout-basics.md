A layout defines the visual structure for a user to interface with your app,
such as in an activity. Android provides a range of libraries, canonical
starting points, and techniques to display and position content.

## Get Started

Start designing Android layouts by learning [app anatomy](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/mobile/guides/layout-and-content/app-anatomy) then how to
[structure your app's content](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/mobile/guides/layout-and-content/content-structure).

## Takeaways

**Layout orientation**


Consider different aspect ratios, size classes, and resolutions that users
might encounter. Verify that your app provides a good user
experience on both landscape and portrait orientation as well as different
screen sizes and form factors.

For more information, see the guidance on
[adapting your layout](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/mobile/guides/layout-and-content/adapt-layout)
and
[canonical layouts](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/mobile/guides/layout-and-content/canonical-layouts).

Honor device safe areas, which includes parts of the UI such as display
cutouts, edge-to-edge insets, edge displays, software keyboards, and
system bars. Provide a flexible layout for users to
interact with the keyboard.
Warning: Be careful when covering content with the keyboard.
Alas, your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. That's OK! You can still [download the video](https://developer.android.com/static/images/design/ui/mobile/layout-basics-video-1.mp4) and watch it with a video player. **Interaction ergonomics**


Keep essential interactions, like primary navigation, in a reachable screen
area. Floating action buttons (FABs) provide a
prominent and reachable interaction point

Use containment to group related content to guide the user through content and
actions. Cards using explicit containment to group content with related actions.

**Alignment**

Provide consistent alignment between similar content and UI elements.

### Do

Establish consistent spacing between like elements. ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/design/ui/mobile/layout-basics_alignment_dont.png)

### Don't

Disrupt readability by inconsistently spacing like elements, which can make designs appear haphazard. **Essential interactions**


Don't overwhelm your user with too many actions per view.

When building custom layouts, notate how content should sit within the layout
using alignment, constraints, or gravity terms. Include how images should
respond to their container to display properly.
